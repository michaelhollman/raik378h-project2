Submitted files:
    ReportPart2.pdf         - analytical portion of the assignment
    output.txt              - the text results of our program
    d3-output.tsv           - an alternative output that we used as the input for our d3 visualization
    screenshot.png          - screenshot of our d3 visualization
    Program.cs              - the main program for our solution
    raik378h-project2.zip   - compressed Visual Studio solution folder (excluding .dat)
    visualization.zip       - compressed source for our d3 visualization


A few notes:
    - We decided to sort our output because it made it easier to compare changes in results as we made changes to the algorithm and it required very little code.
    - The zipped solution file should be runnable "out of the box". It requires that the basket_#.dat files be place within the 'data' folder of the solution.
    - We generated a secondary output from our program to be input directly into our d3 visualization. This eliminated an unnecessary amound of hassle with trying to work with the file format of the primary report.
