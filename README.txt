Submitted files:
    ReportPart1.pdf         - analytical portion of the assignment
    output.txt              - the text results of our program
    Program.cs              - the main program for our solution
    Basket.cs               - C# class for baskets (analogous to basket.h/.c)
    Item.cs                 - C# class for items (analogous to item.h/.c)
    raik378h-project2.zip   - compressed Visual Studio solution folder (excluding .dat)


A few notes:
    - We decided to sort our output because it made it easier to compare changes in results as we made changes to the algorithm and it required very little code.
    - The zipped solution file should be runnable "out of the box". It requires that the basket_#.dat files be place within the 'data' folder of the solution.
